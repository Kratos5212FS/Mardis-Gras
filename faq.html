                    Mardi Gras. Two little words with an infinitely large explanation. For different people it’s
                    different
                    things, an event, an idea, a day, a way of life, piece of history, state holiday, or a million

                    and countless memories. Think you know Mardi Gras? That it’s all about booze and beads? Think again!

                                Jan. 6, Twelfth Night, the Christian holy day of the Epiphany, and ends with Mardi Gras.
                                It's a
                                celebration of life that precedes the fasting and simple living during the Christian

                                Because Easter is variable, Mardi Gras can be any Tuesday between Feb. 3 and March 9 and
                                so
                                the length

                                purple, green and gold. While Arthur Hardy believes they were probably chosen simply
                                because they looked
                                good together, Rex assigned a meaning to the colors in his 1892 parade titled Symbolism
                                of Colors:
                                Purple represents justice, green stands for faith, and gold signifies power.</p>

                            <p class="styleText">By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a
                                family celebration. Those of us who grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our children
                                have grown up and we continue going to every parade, because we used to use "taking the
                                children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold all of the
                                stuff they will catch. Throws often include toys, stuffed animals, beads and more.
                                <br>
                                The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size
                                parades pass anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles
                                Avenue near Napoleon, since parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route.
                                <br>
                                The Garden District portion of St. Charles is a family area where you will see many
                                families staking out their parade watching position, having picnics, playing ball, and
                                having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't have to worry about the streetcars,
                                as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.
                                <br>
                                You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in the suburban areas like
                                Metairie, which is only 10 minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the
                                Saturday before Mardi Gras weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras
                                day. Kids love it!</p>

                                The Mardi Gras day routes are not published anywhere, but they happen in and around
                                their inner city neighborhoods. Some sources say that you will see the Creole Wild West
                                tribe at the corner of LaSalle and 2nd Streets sometime between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. after
                                the Krewe of Zulu passes by. Other tribes meet at the corner of Claiborne and Orleans
                                following the Zulu parade.

                                The New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian Council always has their Indian Sunday on the third
                                Sunday of March, around St. Joseph's Day. Their festivities begin at Noon in A. L. Davis
                                Park (at Washington & LaSalle Streets) where the Mardi Gras Indians once again dress in
                                their feathers and suits, and take to the streets to meet other "gangs."

                                Also, the Tambourine and Fan organizations traditionally hold thier "Super Sunday"
                                parade on the Sunday closest to St. Joseph's Day, with the event beginning at Bayou St.
                                John. In recent years, there has been yet a third Super Sunday called Big Sunday that
                                falls in April during the open weekend between French Quarter Festival and Jazz Fest. No
                                specific details are available on these events at this time.
