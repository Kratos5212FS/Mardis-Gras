                    float
                    designing and building facility in the world. Here more than 80 percent of the floats that journey
                    down
                    New Orleans' streets during the Carnival season are designed and built.
                    <br>
                    Begun in 1947 by float designer and builder Blaine Kern, Mardi Gras World provides visitors with the
                    opportunity to don authentic Mardi Gras costumes and tour enormous warehouses filled with floats.
                    The
                    tour includes a short video and guide who is quite knowledgeable about Mardi Gras history and
                    customs.
                    <br>
                    And for a taste of Mardi Gras, king cake and piping hot New Orleans coffee are served.
                    <br>
                    During the tour, visitors learn about the many traditions surrounding Mardi Gras parades, balls and
                    music, as well as the intricacies of float designing and building. Mardi Gras floats began rumbling
                    down
                    New Orleans streets in 1837 with mule-drawn carriages. Today the tradition continues with
                    sophisticated
                    mega-floats, which hold more than 200 masked riders and are lit with fiber optic cables and laser
                    lights.</p>

                <p class="styleText">LaToya Cantrell, is the current Mayor of the city of New Orleans.
                    <br>
                    <img src="images/latoya.jpg" alt="LaToya" id="latoya">
                    LaToya Cantrell (born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New
                    Orleans, Louisiana, a post she has held since May 7, 2018. Cantrell, a Democrat, is the first
                    woman to hold the post. Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New
                    Orleans City Council from 2012–2018. <br>
                    Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the
                    city's history. Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the
                    goal of creating a strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also
                    founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council tasked with finding solutions to violent crime.
                    Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city use, Cantrell
                    has focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public transportation,
                    public parks, and green spaces. As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New
                    Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid manufacturers and distributors.

                    During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share
                    Agreement with Governor John Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement
                    secured $50 million in upfront funding for the city's infrastructure needs as well as $26
                    million in annual recurring revenue for the city. <br> Following the approval of the Fair Share
                    Agreement, New Orleans voters approved three of the four proposals Mayor Cantrell and the City
                    Council put on the ballot in the 2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale
                    and a tax on short-term rental properties, as well the establishment of a Human Right Commission
                    under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter.

                <h1 class="styleHeading">What about Mardi Gras?</h1>
                <p class="styleText">
                    <img src="images/aboutabout.jpg" alt="mardi gras image" id="whatAbout">
                    The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of
                    New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday,
                    the day before Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there
                    is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest
                    and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final
                    week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and
                    balls (some of them masquerade balls).
                    <br>
                    The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same
                    parade schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of
                    Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super
                    krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is
                    best known for naming celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus
                    (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure
                    Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds.
                    The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw
                    cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route
                    each year.
                    <br>
                    While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades
                    originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal
                    Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux
                    and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the
                    weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of the
                    Courts" between Rex and Comus.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h1 class="styleHeading">Colors and Masks</h1>
                <p class="styleText">In New Orleans, costumes and masks are seldom publicly worn by non-Krewe
                    members on the days before Fat Tuesday (other than at parties), but are frequently worn on Mardi
                    Gras. Laws against concealing one's identity with a mask are suspended for the day. Banks are
                    closed, and some businesses and other places with security concerns (such as convenience stores)
                    post signs asking people to remove their masks before entering.</p>

                <h1 class="styleHeading">A little bit of history</h1>
                <p class="styleText">
                    <img src="images/history1.jpg" alt="mardi gras image" id="hist1">
                    The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through
                    Rome and Venice in the 17th and 18th centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From
                    here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf Gras," or fatted calf, followed France to her
                    colonies.
                    <br><br>
                    On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived
                    at a plot of ground 60 miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi
                    Gras" when his men realized it was the eve of the festive holiday. Bienville also
                    established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702. In 1703, the tiny
                    settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that
                    form our current Mardi Gras krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society"
                    was formed and paraded from 1711 through 1861. The procession was held with a huge bull's
                    head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade with an actual bull, draped
                    in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.
                    <br><br>
                    New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated
                    openly in New Orleans, but not with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s,
                    Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which
                    became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today.
                    <br><br>
                    The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish
                    colonial governing body. That year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was
                    the first of hundreds of clubs and carnival organizations formed in New Orleans.
                    <br><br>
                    By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and
                    horseback riders to celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the
                    way for the krewe's members and lent each event an exciting air of romance and festivity. In
                    1856, six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking John Milton's
                    hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to New Orleans
                    with dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained
                    anonymous.
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers, was formed. This is also the
                    first recorded account of Mardi Gras "throws."
                    <br><br>
                    Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and they even printed "Carnival
                    Edition" lithographs of parades' fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of course -
                    themes and floats were always carefully guarded before the procession). At first, these
                    reproductions were small, and details could not be clearly seen. But beginning in 1886 with
                    Proteus' parade "Visions of Other Worlds," these chromolithographs could be produced in
                    full, saturated color, doing justice to the float and costume designs of Carlotta Bonnecase,
                    Charles Briton and B.A. Wikstrom. Each of these designers' work was brought to life by
                    talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges Soulie', who for 40 years was responsible for
                    <img src="images/history2.jpg" alt="mardi gras image" id="hist2">
                    creating all of Carnival's floats and processional outfits.
                    <br><br>
                    1872 was the year that a group of businessmen invented a King of Carnival, Rex, to preside
                    over the first daytime parade. To honor the visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, the
                    businessmen introduced Romanoff's family colors of purple, green and gold as Carnival's
                    official colors. Purple stands for justice; gold for power; and green for faith. This was
                    also the Mardi Gras season that Carnival's improbable anthem, "If Ever I Cease to Love," was
                    cemented, due in part to the Duke's fondness for the tune.
                    <br><br>
                    The following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in New Orleans instead of
                    France, culminating with Comus' magnificent "The Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of
                    Species," in which exotic paper-mache' animal costumes served as the basis for Comus to mock
                    both Darwin's theory and local officials, including Governor Henry Warmoth. In 1875,
                    Governor Warmoth signed the "Mardi Gras Act," making Fat Tuesday a legal holiday in
                    Louisiana, which it still is.
                    <br><br>
                    Like Comus and the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes today developed from private
                    social clubs with
                    restrictive membership policies. Since all of these parade organizations are completely funded by
                    their members, New
                    Orleanians call it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"
